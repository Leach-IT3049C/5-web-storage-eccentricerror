Find the instructions and rubric in [Instructions.md](Instructions.md)

## Checklist:

- [x] All of my code is pushed up into a repository.
- [x] Fill out the `How to test the Application` section
- [x] The technical write-up of the web storage selection is below.
- [x] Fill out the self-evaluation form.

## How to test the Application:
Add the clothing brand and piece you want, then enter the price. The clothing brand/item should be added to the other div showing what you entered, so you can mark what clothes you want. 

* Where and how is web storage used?
* What are application use cases?

## Technical Write-up of selection of web storage solution: 
I used local storage because I want the list of items you added to stay on the list. That is how local storage works. If I were to use session storage it would dissapear as soon as my session is over and that wouldnt do me any good.

## Self Reflection(s):
Local storage is pretty cool. Nice to learn that JS has a feature like this. I get ID and class mixed up when calling them in JS and the error isnt always cler but now it is something I look for.
## How long it took me/us to finish this: 
2 hours. I was just focusing on mistakes, learning local storage and taking time with css

## Group list, if applicable:
none
